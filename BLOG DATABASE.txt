****** BLOG PROJECT *****

**** PLAN ****

1. Promises - Promises are an alternative to using callbacks. A simpler, arguably more intuitive way of writing asynchronous JavaScript. 

promise.all returns an operation if all promises have been fulfilled, if one has failed then the promise.all is rejected. 

2. Understand Sequelize -
Sequelize is an ORM for Databases - 'Object Relational Mapping'. Allows us to make PostGreSQL requests in ordinary javascript. 

3. Defining Flexible Routes - (look at page 192 of cookbook /206 on pdf/)

4. Understanding Sessions -
