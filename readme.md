IMPLEMENTING THE 2SA INTO THE BLOG APPLICATION



WHAT WE NEED TO DO: 
1. ADD DATABASE FIELDS FOR OUR ADDITIONAL VALUES: "secret_code", "validated".

2. SET DEFAULT VALUES FOR THE ADDTIONAL FIELDS WHENEVER A NEW USER REGISTERS AND GETS ADDED TO THE DATABASE. "Validated" should be "false".

3. UPON LOGIN, WE NEED TO DO THE FOLLOWING:
	a, MAKE THE HTTPS REQUEST TO THE HIGHSIDE API. (with)
	b, WRITE THE HTTPS RESPONSE VALUE CONTAINING THE SECRET CODE into "secret_code" in the DB. 
	b2, BONUS POINT: ADD BCRYPT TO MAKE THE SECRET CODE EVEN MORE SECRET.
	c, RENDER A NEW PAGE OR FORM WHERE THE USER CAN ENTER THE SECRET CODE.
	d, add a way to check if the user is validated, prevent log-in forever if not validated. 

4, UPON SECRET CODE SUBMISSION:
	a, CHECK CODE AGAINST "secret_code" IN DATABASE 
	b, CHANGE VALIDATED STATUS IF CODE IS RIGHT
	c, DO SOMETHING ELSE IF IT'S WRONG (e.g a horrible message berating their forgetfulness)
	c2, BONUS POINT: IF IT'S WRONG HAVE FUNCTIONALITY TO SEND ANOTHER CODE (remember to change the current secret_code).
	d, SET THE SESSION/OTHER DETAILS AS WE WOULD AFTER A NORMAL LOGIN.
	e, REDIRECT THE PAGE TO HOME/DASHBOARD/WHATEVER YOUR LANDING PAGE IS. 


WHAT THE HIGHSIDE API DOES:
1, UPON RECEIVING THE HTTPS GET REQUEST: 
	a, GENERATE CODE
	b, SEND CODE VIA SMS/PHONE CALL TO RECIPIENT IN GET REQUEST ATTRIBUTE
	c, RETURN THE HTTPS RESPONSE WITH CODE AND OTHER VARIABLES.
